%\subsection{Planning second half}
% 1 page
The best way to get the project back on track is through careful planning. First of all we needed to get an overview of the remaining parts of the project, and then we wanted to carefully structure and plan: What needs to be done?, In what order? and How much time do we have?

We have divided the planning up into four parts.

We start out by looking at the development methods that we want to use. We give a brief introduction to the method, and explain how we applied it to help the project back on track.

After this we describe the estimation methods we use. The estimation methods should help us make accurate estimations. This, in turn, helps us to meet the deadline, as most of our estimations should be correct or close to.

Now that we have found out how much time we need, we need to find out how much time we have available. For this we use a couple of methods for planning the time. Those methods are explained, and our usage is analyzed.

As the last, but possibly the most important part, we look into how our project rescue has affected the quality. Less time to do roughly the same work must have some effect on the quality. This is analyzed.
