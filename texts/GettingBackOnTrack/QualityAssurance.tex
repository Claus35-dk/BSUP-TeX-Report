\subsection{Quality assurance}
To be able to measure the quality of our client we used the requirements we set to the client along with a test strategy to ensure as little errors as possible and the methods descriped earlier in this chapter. We moved from the initial level of Capability Maturity Model while developing the server to the managed level during the development of the client. We kept to the initial level during the development of the server, by developing as we went along.The usage of a test strategy, increased the likelyhood of finding errors early and correcting them, thereby minimizing the costs of correcting the errors.
