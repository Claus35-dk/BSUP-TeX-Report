\subsection{Method of development}
% 3 pages
We like Scrum as a software development method, but we decided not to do full-on Scrum. Scrum has a lot of activities, some of which we chose not to use, since we were short on time. We chose not to use Daily Scrum. We are a small group of only 5 people, so communicating is not that difficult and we don't have the roles used for proper Scrum (Product owner, Scrum master, etc.).

We chose to use a Scrum artifact: The backlog. The backlog is a list of items. Each item describes a `story', possibly with sub stories or tasks, that needs to be completed. An item on a backlog could be ``Implement controller class'' or ``Write problem statement''. Our complete backlog can be viewed in Appendix, \ref{illustrations}, Figure \ref{backlog}, page~\pageref{backlog}.

We used Scrumwise.com as our Scrum tool. Scrum task board and burndown chart were given to us. They helped us gain overview doing the project. Our task board can be viewed in Appendix, \ref{illustrations}, Figure \ref{taskboard}, page~\pageref{taskboard}. Our burndown chart can be viewed in Appendix, \ref{illustrations}, Figure \ref{burndown}, page~\pageref{burndown}.
