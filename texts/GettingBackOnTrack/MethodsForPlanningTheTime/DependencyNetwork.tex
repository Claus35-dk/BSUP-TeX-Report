\subsubsection{Dependency network with activity durations}
After planning all our group meetings we decided to create a dependency network with activity durations. We had several reasons for doing this:

\begin{itemize}
	\item We wanted to make sure that everyone always knew what to do. A dependency network is great for this purpose, as everyone can easily see which elements must precede others.
	\item We wanted to clearly identify the critical path. This allowed us to make sure that minimum slack was applied to the path and to keep the project within its designated time frame.
	\item To be able to see available slack of backlog items. This helped us very much in determining which items to complete first.
\end{itemize}

\cref{dependency network} shows our dependency network.
Some important parts to point out that we learned from this network:
\begin{itemize}
	\item It shows that testing WCF controller can be pushed all the way to the 73\textsuperscript{rd} hour. We expected that this part was not that important, but the network really confirmed us in this expectation.
	\item It shows that we have to begin programming the controllers/models before views. It also shows that not all controllers/models need to be finished before the first views can be implemented. It shows exactly which controllers/models that needs to be finished.
\end{itemize}

[ TODO: Mention how the hours did not work fully as measurement of time left, as more tasks than we had team members were parallelized. Also mention variant. ]
As seen in \cref{dependency network} we are simply not able to complete all the parallel processes, as we are only five in the group. That means that the network cannot be used to measure time left. We have to take into account the delay on the processes that are parallel and exceed five which the maximum amount of group members available.

The network has helped us a lot in our work, and we have returned to it many times throughout the project.
