\subsubsection{GANTT diagram}
GANTT diagrams can be an extremely efficient tool for planning in larger groups. Some overhead must be expected, but it can help to keep developers on track so they always know what to do.

The overhead from using a GANTT diagram can be caused by the fact that you create an order in which the program should be created. We want it to be agile enough to be able to switch between items as we like.

We had spent a lot of time constructing a thorough dependency network, and we decided to use this alone, as the base of doing items. We agreed that the dependency network provided the right overview of our items.

Because we had a project that was derailed, we feared that the overhead applied by using a GANTT diagram would be too high, compared to the benefit gained from it. The benefit would also be minimal, because of our extensive dependency network.
