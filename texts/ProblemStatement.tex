\section{Problem statement}
% 0.5 page
If we have a project that has gone off its rails. How do we get it back on track, meeting both the requirements and the deadline?
\begin{itemize}
\item Which planning tools and methods can we use to our benefit?
\item Which selection of development methods is able to boost our productivity with minimum overhead from using the methods themselves?
\item Which methods should we use to maintain and measure quality?
\item How well does application of these methods allow us to recover our project, as determined from the quality of the final product?
\end{itemize}
We will also reflect upon when we think the project derailed, why it did so, and which measurements we could have taken to prevent it.
