\section{Problem statement}
% 1 page
We have a project that has gone of its rails. How do we get it back on its tracks and how do we meet both the requirements and the deadline?
\newline
\begin{itemize}
\item Which planning tools can we use to our benefit?
\item Which development methods can we use, without spending too much time on the method itself?
\item Which methods should we use to maintain and measure quality?
\item How does our project recovery influence the quality of the project?
\end{itemize}
We would also like to discuss when we think the project derailed and which measurements could have been taken to prevent it. Would some SCRUM (or similar) artifacts be sufficient or should one follow a chosen development method fully?
