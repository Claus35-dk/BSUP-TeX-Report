\section{Perspective}

For future projects we will definitely not reject SCRUM as easily as we did in the first part of this project. We have learned that applying just some of the practices gives far better results than developing without any structure at all.

With our experience from this project, we will not hesitate to dismiss SCRUM sprints if the project they are for is minor. On the other side, sprints are worth considering if the project allows it - for our project we speculate it could have meant that at least some of the unforseen tasks had become foreseen, because a separate sprint for only a subset of all features allows greater focus on these and their needs, in comparison to a single sprint which includes all planned functionality.

Two practices all members of the group have expressed pleasure with are Planning Poker and the use of Dependency Networks. For future projects these are valuable tools we definitely will consider to use.

Having something like nearly constant review, like we had with our use of peer reviewing, also yielded good results. For future work in groups sized about the same as ours, peer reviewing is something which should be considered if the group members are not on same page in regards to a particular tool or language.
