For further projects using planning and estimating tools like Planning Poker will defiantly be a priority from the start. If the time is present using sprints within SCRUM will be a possibility worth considering, but for minor project it does not seems worth the struggle.
Using a ScrumBut seems all in all like a very good idea if the project is not to big, there are not to much time and the working group(s) are not to huge. Taking these parameters in mind, an effective ScrumBut could be possible to create.

All members of the group have expressed pleasure of the use of the dependency network diagram, thus that is something we all will be considering in future project.

Having something near constant review, like we have with our use of peer reviewing, should always be taking into consideration.

- discuss our findings. Will be do the same another time? What would we do different?
