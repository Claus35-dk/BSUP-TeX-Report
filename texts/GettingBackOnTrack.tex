We have a derailed project. We will now try to get the project back on its tracks, using various planing methods, development methods and estimation methods.

\subsection{Summary}
First step was to plan the rest of the project. We used the SCRUM artifact Backlog to get an overview. We estimated work hours for each item on the backlog, to further enhance our overview. This gave us an estimate of the number of remaining hours. We also planned our available hours. Comparing our available working hours with the hours remaining in the project, showed us that we had just enough time, assuming our estimates rang true. ``The project is not derailed then?'' you might ask, and it was: We planned a lot more available hours in order to meet the project's remaining hours.
