\section{Getting back on track}
% 13 pages
We will now describe how we plan to get the project back on its tracks.

Doing this is going to take a lot of planning. However, while planning can help structure the collaboration, it can add quite a bit of overhead. Therefore, we must carefully select the extent of our planning, and the methods we wanted to use. If we use to long planning, we might never start the project, and if we use to little time planning, everything might derail again.

In the following sections we will describe the methods used to get the project back on track. Where possible we will reflect upon the results of using that particular method as well.

\subsection{Summary}
First step was to plan the rest of the project. We used the SCRUM artifact Backlog to get an overview. We estimated work hours for each item on the backlog, to further enhance our overview. This gave us an estimate of the number of remaining hours. We also planned our available hours. Comparing our available working hours with the hours remaining in the project, showed us that we had just enough time, assuming our estimates rang true. ``The project is not derailed then?'' you might ask, and it was: We planned a lot more available hours in order to meet the project's remaining hours.
