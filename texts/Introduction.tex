This paper was written for the course `System Development and Project Organization, BSUP' at ITU in the spring 2013.

In almost every software development project some degree of planning and application of development methods are needed - the need for those increases with the size of the project group, the project size, and critical factors \cite{ac}. For larger projects the right choices of planning and development methods are essential for meeting the requirements and deadlines.\\
When a project goes of track it is essential to know how to get it back on track in order to complete the project with minimal added cost and delays. % Obvious?

When a project has derailed, it can be difficult get it back up and running. First one must review and adjust the chosen methods used for the project to avoid further derail from happening, which involves discovering why the project derailed in the first place.
Once the work process has been adjusted, changes to the project plan are also necessary in order to finish the project on time and with desirable quality. If nothing is done, the project will probably not be finished within the designated time frame.

In this paper we will consider such a derailed project. We will analyze the cause of the problems and apply proper methods to get it back on track so it can be delivered on time.
Finally we will discuss and conclude how well we managed to perform the task based on the resulting quality.
