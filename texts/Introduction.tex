In almost every software development projects some degree of planning and development methods is needed - the needs for those factors rises with the size of the project group, the project size and critical factors. For larger projects the right chooses of planning and development methods is essential for meeting the requirements and being done on time.\\
But when a project has gone of track it is necessary to know how to get it back on track to complete the project with minimal cost and delay.

When a project has derailed, it can be difficult get it back up and running. The reasons for why it has derailed must be discovered, and the right measurements must be taken to avoid another derail. This includes review and adjust the chosen methods used for the project.

In this paper we will consider a derailed project. We will find and apply the right methods to get it back on track and able to be delivered on time.

At first, we will analyse the derailed project, what went wrong and why did it do so. After this we will find relevant methods to "rescue" the project. At the end we will discuss the result and end up with a conclusion.
