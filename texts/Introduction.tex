This paper was written for the course `System Development and Project Organization, BSUP' at ITU in the spring 2013.

In almost every software development projects some degree of planning and development methods is needed - the needs for those factors rises with the size of the project group, the project size and critical factors. For larger projects the right choices in planning and development methods is essential for meeting the requirements and finishing on time.\\
But when a project has gone of track it is necessary to know how to get it back on track to complete the project with minimal added cost and delay.

When a project has derailed, it can be difficult to get it back up and running. The reasons why it has derailed must be discovered, and the right measurements must be taken to avoid complication. This includes reviewing and adjusting the chosen methods used for the project.

In this paper we will consider a derailed project. We will find and apply the right methods to get it back on track and able to be delivered on time.

At first, we analyzed the derailed project, what went wrong and why did it do so. After that we found the relevant methods to `rescue' the project. At the end we discussed the results and end up with a conclusion.
