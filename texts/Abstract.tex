When a software project runs amok and gets delayed rarely anyone benefits from it.
When it happens, it is crucial to know which selection of methods to apply in order to get the project back on track and end as close to the deadline as possible.
In this paper we will consider a derailed project of small size, which is relatively simple and run by a group of about five members.
We consider multiple development, planning, and estimation methods, assessing their benefits and drawbacks if they were applied to a project of the considered type.

Through use of Planning Poker, a variant of SCRUM, a dependency network diagram, peer reviewing, and a custom method for planning meetings, we show how a project similar the one described may be helped back on track.
