When a software project goes off the tracks and gets delayed rarely anyone benefits from it. When this happens, and it does, it's crucial to know of methods to get the project back on track and end as close to the deadline as possible. In this paper we will consider a derailed project. We analyses different methods and chooses the ones we see fits the best for the current project. By using Planning Poker, a ScrumBut, dependency network diagram and other methods we show how we tried to get the project back on track.
